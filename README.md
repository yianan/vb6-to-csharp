# vb6-to-csharp

A Claude Code plugin that migrates VB6 codebases to a modern stack: **ASP.NET Core + EF Core + SQLite** on the backend, **Vite + React + TypeScript** on the frontend.

## What's inside

- **Slash commands**
  - `/vb6-migrate` — orchestrate a full migration: inventory, architecture interview, plan, execute
  - `/vb6-inventory` — just the inventory step (forms, controls, SQL, schema inference)
  - `/vb6-translate-form <path>` — translate a single `.frm` to a React page + needed API endpoints
- **Subagent**: `vb6-migration-architect` — reads an inventory, asks 3-5 design questions, writes a phased plan
- **Skills** (auto-loaded by trigger):
  - `vb6-language-mapping` — VB6 ↔ C# syntax/semantics
  - `vb6-error-handling` — `On Error Goto` / `Resume Next` / `Err` → `try`/`catch`
  - `vb6-data-types` — `Variant`, `Currency`, 1-based arrays, `Option Base`
  - `vb6-form-controls` — TextBox / MSFlexGrid / MSADODC → React equivalents
  - `vb6-ado-patterns` — global `ADODB.Connection` → DI'd `DbContext` + parameterized LINQ
  - `vb6-frm-parser` — `.frm` file format reference
  - `dotnet-sqlite-scaffold` — exact ASP.NET Core 10 + EF Core + SQLite recipe
  - `vite-react-crud-scaffold` — exact Vite + React + TanStack Query CRUD recipe
  - `mssql-bak-to-sqlite` — restore a SQL Server `.bak` and migrate data into SQLite

## Install

### Claude Code CLI

```
/plugin marketplace add yianan/vb6-to-csharp
/plugin install vb6-to-csharp@vb6-to-csharp
```

### Claude Desktop (macOS)

`/plugin` is gated in Desktop sessions, so use Desktop's account-upload flow instead:

```sh
./scripts/build-plugin.sh             # produces vb6-to-csharp.plugin (a zip)
open -a Claude ./vb6-to-csharp.plugin # or drag the .plugin file onto Claude.app
```

Desktop uploads it to your account's plugins marketplace and syncs it back into the local cache. After that, `/vb6-migrate` is available in Desktop sessions. Re-run `build-plugin.sh` and re-open the file to push updates.

## Usage

In any directory containing a VB6 project (`.vbp`, `.frm`, `.bas`):

```
/vb6-migrate
```

The plugin inventories the source, asks architecture questions, writes a plan, and executes it phase by phase.

## Provenance

Built alongside a real VB6 → modern-stack migration of a library-management app. Every skill contains examples from that migration; the seed app is the smoke-test bed. As you exercise the plugin on new codebases, please update the relevant skill's "examples" section with what you learned and any new gotchas.

## Status

- ✅ Slash commands and architect agent in place
- ✅ Core skills (language, error handling, data types, controls, ADO, frm parser)
- ✅ Scaffold skills (dotnet-sqlite, vite-react)
- ⚠️ `mssql-bak-to-sqlite` is documentation-only — pattern is correct but not yet exercised end-to-end
- ⚠️ No automated tests yet; verify by running `/vb6-migrate` against a fresh VB6 codebase
